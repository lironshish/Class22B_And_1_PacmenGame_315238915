## The app is my version to Pacmen Game
### There are 2 Players -> fish & shark. 
### The game starts with 3 lives. After each collision between the fish and the shark - One disqualification will go down. After 3 collisions the game will end.
### The user moves the fish with the arrows. Each time the fish changes his direction of movement the shark changes his direction of movement at random. The players move in a circular motion
### The game will start as soon as the user clicks on one of the arrows and the movement will start.
